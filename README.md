## Installation

- Before installing the project, make sure you have ruby installed in your system. If not, you can following the instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/emekafredy/Daily-Product.git`
- move to the project directory with `cd Daily-Product`
- run **_bundle install_** (This installs the needed dependencies, including Sinatra)
- run `rackup` to start up the app

- **NB** If you're making some changes in the code, please install `rerun` globally with `rvm @global do gem install rerun` and start up the server with `rerun app.rb`. This reloads the server whenever changes are made to an important part of the code thereby saving us the stress of stopping and re-starting the server to view changes.
